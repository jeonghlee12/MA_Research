abstract = {This paper studies the role and implications of price advertising when shopping trips are costly to consumers. The authors present a model where consumers search sequentially and where stores advertise the price. Their model has a unique equilibrium exhibiting price dispersion. The model generates predictions about the shape of the price distribution and firms' advertising behavior. Also when the initial advertising costs are precisely zero, entry drives the equilibrium to the perfectly competitive outcome; while otherwise entry drives prices higher. Finally, when advertising costs shrink, prices become competitive; however, when search costs shrink, prices remain bounded above marginal production costs.

 abstract = {We consider an oligopoly model in which consumers engage in sequential search based on partial product information and advertised prices. By applying Weitzman's (1979) optimal sequential search solution, we derive a simple static condition that fully summarizes consumers' shopping outcomes and translates the pricing game among the sellers into a familiar discrete-choice problem. Exploiting the discrete-choice reformulation, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of market equilibrium and analyze the effects of preference diversity and search frictions on market prices. Among other things, we show that a reduction in search costs raises market prices.},

abstract = {The Pandora's Box Problem, originally formalized by Weitzman in 1979, models selection from a set of options each with stochastic parameters, when evaluation (i.e. sampling) is costly. This includes, for example, the problem of hiring a skilled worker, where only one hire can be made, but the evaluation of each candidate is an expensive procedure.Weitzman showed that the Pandora's Box Problem admits a simple and elegant solution which considers the options in decreasing order of the value it which opening has exactly zero marginal revenue. We study for the first time this problem when the order in which the boxes are opened is constrained, which forces the threshold values to account for both the depth of search, as opening a box gives access to more boxes, and breadth, as there are many directions to explore in. Despite these difficulties, we show that greedy optimal strategies exist and can be efficiently computed for tree-like order constraints.We also prove that finding approximately optimal adaptive search strategies is NP-hard when certain matroid constraints are used to further restrict the set of boxes which may be opened, or when the order constraints are given as reachability constraints on a DAG. We complement the above result by giving approximate adaptive search strategies based on a connection between optimal adaptive strategies and non-adaptive strategies with bounded adaptivity gap for a carefully relaxed version of the problem.},

abstract = {In a model introduced by Weitzman an agent called Pandora opens boxes sequentially, in whatever order she likes, discovers prizes within, and optimally stops. Her aim is to maximize the expected value of the greatest discovered prize, minus the costs of opening the boxes. The solution, using the so-called Pandora rule, is attractive and has many applications. However, it does not address applications in which the payoff depends on all discovered prizes, rather than just the best of them, nor is it easy to say whether or not some generalized Pandora rule might do so. Here, we establish a sense in which it cannot. We discover that if a generalized Pandora rule is to be optimal for some more general utility, and all model parameters, then the problem can be solved via a second problem having Weitzman's form of utility.},

abstract = {I study a single-agent sequential search problem as in Weitzman (1979). Contrary to Weitzman, conditional on stopping, the agent may take any uninspected box without first inspecting its contents. This introduces a new trade-off. By taking a box without inspection, the agent saves on its inspection costs. However, by inspecting it, he may discover that its contents are lower than he anticipated. I identify sufficient conditions on the parameters of the environment under which I characterize the optimal policy. Both the order in which boxes are inspected and the stopping rule may differ from that in Weitzman's model. Moreover, I provide additional results that partially characterize the optimal policy when these conditions fail.}
